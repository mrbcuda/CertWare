<h1>Review Navigation Page</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<div class="background">

The review wizard's proof navigation page shows the list of statements in the semi-formal proof argument.  This navigation page is used to raise details about each statement in the opposing pane.    

</div>

<h2>Application</h2>
<div class="application">

Select a statement in the navigation pane to raise its details in the opposing pane.  There are two kinds of detail pages available: one for the proof statement (the first or Theorem line) and one for the supporting statements.  Each statement line will show its validation status (valid, invalid, or unknown) as the icon associated with the statement.  Typically a review wizard session will focus on eliminating invalid and unknown status flags.  Use the validation buttons on the details pages to change these flags.  
<p>
The review panes normally are opposed left-to-right, but using the layout buttons in the top right-hand corner of the wizard dialog one can choose a top-to-bottom orientation.
