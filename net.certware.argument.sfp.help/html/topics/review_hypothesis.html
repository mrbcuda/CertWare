<h1>Hypothesis Statement</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<div class="background">

The review wizard's statement detail page includes a trivial special case for hypothesis statements.  A statement marked as a hypothesis does not require other justifications, but it may be used elsewhere to support an inference.  Typically a hypothesis statement starts with the word "Suppose" but this is not enforced in the tools; in CertWare, the only indication is the use of the keyword <b>hypothesis</b> as the justification comment.
<p>
The hypothesis statements usually stand alone.  On the details page, there typically will be no other premises, inferences, entailments, or deductions provided to describe the statement and its role in the argument. 
</div>

<h2>Application</h2>
<div class="application">

Use the wizard's validation buttons at the bottom of the details page to assign a validation record to the statement according to whether the hypothesis is valid, invalid, or unknown.  The wizard will apply this choice as well as the author and time stamp records to the selected statement.
