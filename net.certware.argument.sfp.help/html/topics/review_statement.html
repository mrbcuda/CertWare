<h1>Statement Detail Page</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<div class="background">

The review wizard's statement detail page shows the justifications claimed to support the selected statement, and prompts for the reviewer to validate this claim.  If the argument is written correctly, then the information on this detail page should stand alone to support the statement.  If so, then the claim can be marked as valid, or if not it can be marked as invalid and thereby require rework.  
</div>

<h2>Application</h2>
<div class="application">
Use the wizard's validation buttons at the bottom of the details page to assign a validation record to the statement according to whether the statement and its justification is valid, invalid, or unknown. The wizard will apply this choice as well as the author and time stamp records to the selected statement.
