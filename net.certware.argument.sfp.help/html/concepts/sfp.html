<h1>Semi-Formal Proof Argument</h1>

One can present a safety case arguments using the style of <em>semi-formal proofs</em>.  The individual claims and evidence
in the case argument become the theorems, premises, inferences, and deductions in the semi-formal proof language.  

CertWare provides an editor for the semi-formal proof (SFP) language and an accompanying review wizard that guides the
case author or verifier through the argument for validation.  Invoke the editor by opening a file with the extension
of <b>*.sfp</b>.  Invoke the review wizard by raising the context menu (right-click) on the SFP file and choose the 
<b>Review Proof</b> menu option.  The wizard presents the proof step-by-step, showing only the relevant parts of the
argument for verification.  The SFP file includes a verification record for each statement, including the verification
result, verification author, and a time stamp.   

<h2>Background</h2>
<div class="background">

A <em>semi-formal proof</em> is a proof structure in which the overall arrangement of a proof is a
formal data structure, while individual propositions within the structure are expressed either formally or informally. 
The motivation is to make the proof easier to review by human readers, while preserving some automated
verification capabilities.
