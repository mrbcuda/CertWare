<h1>Claim-Argument-Evidence Notation</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<div class="background">
The claim-argument-evidence (CAE) notation is a derivative of the ASCAD notation from Adelard LLP.  It provides a graphical means of setting out
hierarchical Safety Arguments following the approach of legal reasoning, starting with a claim and then showing how that claim is fulfilled by evidence.
Similar to the goal structuring notation (GSN), this logical approach, if correctly applied, brings some rigor into the process of deriving 
Safety Arguments and provides the means for capturing essential explanatory material, 
including assumptions, context and justifications, within the argument framework.
