<h1>Goal Structuring Notation</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<div class="background">
Goal-structuring Notation (GSN), developed by the University of York, provides a graphical means of setting out 
hierarchical Safety Arguments, with textual annotations and references to supporting Evidence.
The logical approach of GSN, if correctly applied, brings some rigor into the process of deriving 
Safety Arguments and provides the means for capturing essential explanatory material, 
including assumptions, context and justifications, within the argument framework.

An <b>Argument</b> should take the form of a simple predicate - i.e. a statement which can be shown to be only true or false.
GSN provides for the structured, logical decomposition of Arguments into lower-level Arguments. 
For an Argument structure to be sufficient, it is essential to ensure that, at each level of decomposition:
<ul>
<li>the set of Arguments covers everything that is needed in order to show that the parent Argument is true;
<li>there is no valid (counter) Argument that could undermine the parent Argument.
</ul>
If this principle is applied rigorously all the way down through and across a GSN structure, 
then it is necessary to show only that each Argument at the very bottom of the structure is satisfied 
(i.e. shown to be true) in order to assert that the top-level Claim has been satisfied. 
Satisfaction of the lowest-level Arguments is the purpose of Evidence.
