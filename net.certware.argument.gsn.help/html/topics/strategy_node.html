<h1>Strategy Nodes</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<div class="background">
A goal (or set of goals) can be solved by a <b>strategy</b>, which breaks a goal into a number of sub-goals. 
The satisfactory solution of the sub-goals then entails the solution of the original goals. 
A strategy can be regarded as a rule to be invoked in the solution of goals. 
If we have a general strategy which is based on a number of assumptions then we will also have 
an obligation to demonstrate that these assumptions can validly be made. 
There will be situations in which goals are conflicting, and a strategy needs to be introduced 
to make a trade-off, e.g. 
<em>achieving safety in potentially dangerous situations through shutdown and maintaining a 
high availability by keeping the plant up and running.</em>

Strategies are a useful means of adding “comment” to the structure to explain, for example, how the decomposition will develop. 
They are not predicates and do not form part of the logical decomposition of the Argument; 
rather, they are there purely for explanation of the decomposition.

<h2>Application</h2>
<div class="application">
To add a strategy node to the case argument model, right-click on a <b>Goal</b> node, 
choose <b>Add Child...</b> from the pop-up menu, and choose <b>Strategy</b>.  Select the new strategy node
and then complete its properties in the property sheet form.
