<h1>Assumption Nodes</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<div class="background">
An <b>assumption</b> provides a premise for a goal.  Note: in some cases it is referred to as a <b>model</b>.  
A goal is couched in terms of some model of the system, or its environment. 
A goal may often be expressed over a number of models. We do not constrain the form that the model may take; 
it may be a plant schematic, a process description, or an architectural model, etc. 
The goal will refer to objects within the models it is expressed over, e.g. <em>the auxiliary feed pump is to be switched on when....</em>	
It provides a basis for linking the safety case and supporting analysis to the design.

An Assumption is a statement whose validity has to be relied upon in order to make an Argument.
Assumptions may also be attached to other GSN elements including Strategies and Evidence (or Solutions).

</div>

<h2>Application</h2>
<div class="application">
To add an assumption node to the case argument model, right-click on a <b>Goal</b> node, 
choose <b>Add Child...</b> from the pop-up menu, and choose <b>Assumption</b>.  Select the new assumption node
and then complete its properties in the property sheet form.
