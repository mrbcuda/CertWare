<h1>Justification Nodes</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<div class="background">
Strategies often need some justification for their use. 
It may be that the strategy is laid down in some standard followed by the developers, 
e.g. <em>ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section III recommends that it be done</em>; 
it may be common practice; or it may be a more elaborate argument as to the validity of the use of the strategy. 
Alternatively a justification may call upon evidence from analysis of the model or be a structured proof.

A Justification is used to give a rationale for the use or satisfaction of a particular Argument or Strategy. 
More generally it can be used to justify the change that is the subject of the Safety Case.

<h2>Application</h2>
<div class="application">
To add a justification node to the case argument model, right-click on a <b>Strategy</b> node, 
choose <b>Add Child...</b> from the pop-up menu, and choose <b>Justification</b>.  Select the new justification node
and then complete its properties in the property sheet form.
