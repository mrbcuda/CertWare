<h1>Goal Nodes</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<div class="background">
A <b>goal</b> is a requirement, target or constraint to be met by the system or parts of it. 
Goals are intended to be sufficiently general so that they can also capture process issues, 
e.g. <em>develop to the requirements of Interim Defence Standard 00-55</em>. 
A goal hierarchy refers to the collection of goals produced by hierarchical decomposition into sub-goals. 
A Goal is usually "owned" by some stakeholder.
</div>

<h2>Application</h2>
<div class="application">
To add a goal node to the case argument model, right-click on a <b>Goal</b> or <b>Strategy</b> node, 
choose <b>Add Child...</b> from the pop-up menu, and choose <b>Goal</b>.  Select the new goal
and then complete its properties in the property sheet form.
