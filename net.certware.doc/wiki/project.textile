h2. Documentation

h3. Javadoc

Running the built-in Javadoc from Eclipse workbench with standard doclet.  Use @Project->Generate Javadoc@ to start the wizard.  Select all projects in the workspace.  Using additional VM and doclet tag settings as below:

* @-J-Xmx512M@ for the virtual machine.
* @-tag generated:a:"Generated" -tag generatedBy:a:"Generated by" -tag ordered:a:"Ordered" -tag model:a:"Model"@ for special tags.

The typical output goes to the local disk in a Javadoc directory.  The @overview.html@ file is kept in the @net.certware.doc@ project's @javadoc@ folder.  It is also possible to run the @pdfdoclet@ on these files even without an associated configuration file.     

h3. Meta-Models

* @ARM@ OMG argument metamodel and its Ecore implementation
* @CAE@ A claim-argument-evidence metamodel derived from the ARM metamodel.
* @CAZ@ A diagram for claim-argument-evidence notation derived from CAE and ARM metamodels.
* @EUR@ A EUROCONTROL notation metamodel derived from the ARM metamodel and reflecting the slight differences of this notation from GSN.  
* @EUZ@ A diagram for EUROCONTROL notation derived from EUR and ARM metamodels.

h3. Development

h4. Running the EEF Tools

We use the Eclipse Extended Editing Framework to provide better properties sheets for the EMF model editors.  The EEF model initialization occurs from the original @*.genmodel@ files in the model plugins.  
# The EEF model artifacts are redirected to the @EMF.Edit@ plugins, where a @model@ folder was created to contain the EEF models.  
# In the @*.eefgen@ model created, check that the generation directory property points to a source folder (typically @src-gen@) and that the builder identifies this as a source folder (e.g. @Build Path -> Use as Source Folder@).  
# Be sure to add the @model@ folder and the @src-gen@ folders to the plugin's @build.properties@ selections as necessary.  
# Add @org.eclipse.emf.eef.runtime@ as a plugin dependency, and in its properties select the re-export dependency option so that the @EMF.editor@ project can see it.  
# Run the @eefgen@ to create the new packages. 
# In the @EMF.edit@ plugin expose all of the packages in the runtime tab.  
# In the @EMF.editor@ plugin add the three standard provider extensions to enable the EEF contributions (see the generated plugin fragment for the class name references), then add individual extensions for the tabbed property parts for example.  
# In the generated editor file make it implement the tabbed properties interface @org.eclipse.ui.views.properties.tabbed.ITabbedPropertySheetPageContributor@ and implement the one method that returns the contributor ID as defined in the plugin extension. 
# Change the @PropertySheetPage@ reference type to @TabbedPropertySheetPage@ and modify the @getPropertySheetPage()@ method to work with the tabbed property sheet.  
# Add the double-click listener on the selection viewer.    

h4. Running the GMF Tools

The graphical model editors we create with the Eclipse Epsilon Eugenia tools for GMF (0.8.9, later 0.9.0).  Use the following steps:
# Apply the Eugenia metadata annotations to the features in the desired Ecore metamodel files (e.g. add the tags to the @gsn.ecore@ file).
# From the @genmodel@ editor and root model node, run the corresponding @genmodel@ file to create the basic EMF model, edit, and editor support source and plugins.  
# From the explorer's context menu on the @ecore@ file run the @Eugenia -> Generate GMF tool, graph, and map models@ command.  This will yield the @gmfgraph@, @gmfmap@, and @gmftool@ files next to the @ecore@ file.  Note of the @gmfmap@ file does not appear there is something wrong with the model structure or annotations although no error messages are produced; typical issues are container point-backs and nodes with identical tool names.
# From the explorer's context menu on the @gmfmap@ file run the @Create generator model command.@  This will run the wizard to create the @gmfgen@ file.  Note that the "Load" buttons should be used on each page and that the notification that the @genmodel@ file is out of date seems to be spurious.
# Edit the @gmfgen@ model's edit part properties to set Validation Enabled and Validation Decorators to @true@.  
# Edit the @gmfgen@ model's edit part properties to set the metamodel Display Name property to the diagram type, e.g. @GSN Argument Diagram@.  This value appears in the property sheet header when the argument canvas is selected.
# From the explorer's context menu on the @gmfgen@ file run the @Create diagram code@ command.  This will yield the @diagram@ plugin.  Ensure this new plugin is in the run configuration or deployment package.  

Afterward some adjustments may be necessary if wrapped labels are wanted inside figures.  The default layout manager seems to work fine for the children items on a figure (e.g. two wrapped labels inside an ellipse).  But the default is to truncate these labels, and the default is to provide a skimpy editor for the labels.  To make the adjustments from the generated code:
# In the @*diagram.edit.parts@ package edit the @createContents()@ method of @MyEditPart@ class's @MyFigure@ inner class.  For each @WrappedLabel@ child added in this method, set @setTextWrap(true)@ as in 			@fFigureContextLabelFigure.setTextWrap(true);@.  Set the @NOT@ flag on the generated tag.    
# In the same package edit the @setManager@ method of the @MyXyzEditPart@ for the label requiring a better editor, where @Xyz@ is the label child name.  Replace the call to @TextDirectEditManager.getTextCellEditorClass(this)@ with one to @WrapTextCellEditor.class@.  Apply the quick fix to the include file to eliminate the two warnings as this refers to internal API.  Set the @NOT@ flag on the generated tag.  The resulting method should resemble:
bc. 
	/**
	 * @generated NOT
	 */
	protected DirectEditManager getManager() {
		if (manager == null) {
			setManager(new TextDirectEditManager(this,
			// TextDirectEditManager.getTextCellEditorClass(this),
					WrapTextCellEditor.class,
					GszEditPartFactory.getTextCellEditorLocator(this)));
		}
		return manager;
	}
	

h4. Running the Xtext Tools

The Xtext DSL initialization is done with the wizard for creating Xtext projects from Ecore files.  Choose the EPackage desired and any of its imports so that the complete grammar is generated, and choose an appropriate entry rule because the default is not satisfactory.  For example, to create the GSN DSL choose both GSN and ARM packages, and choose the Goal class as the entry rule.  Some string type manipulation may need to be done in the resulting grammar specification.  When the wizard completes it is necessary to run the workflow.  First editor the workflow run configuration file (labeled @mwe2@) and add more memory for the virtual machine, e.g. @-Xmx1024m@). Run this MWE generator on the @mwe2@ file.  This will produce or update two or three more plug-ins depending on selections in the wizard.  Edits to the generated code might include tasks such as
# Modify the label and image provider in the @*.ui.labeling.*LabelProvider@ package to provide labels and icons for the outline.  The icons path presumes the @icons/@ path so provide text path beyond that root. 
# Create an exporter or command that writes the file as a duplicate with a different extension associated with a different installed editor.  The DSL-extension file can in fact be opened with the EMF-extension editor, but this is not obvious without cloning and renaming the file.  Example: @*.gsnl@ can be opened with either GSN DSL or GSN Ecore editors.  Code to do this might use the Resource object in EMF, as in
bc. 
Resource res = resourceSet.createResource(URI.createURI("myFile.xmi"));
res.getContents().add(model);
res.save(null);

or

bc. 
Injector inj = new 
MyLanguageStandaloneSetup().createInjectorAndDoEMFRegistrati on();
ResourceSet resourceSet = inj.getInstance(ResourceSet.class);
Resource res = resourceSet.createResource(URI.createURI("myFile.xmi"));
res.getContents().add(model);
res.save(null);

h4. Running the Export Tools

Exporting is done with @docx4j@ and a depth-first visitor pattern.  The visitor uses the EMF collections iterators and Ecore switch generated by the model generator.  

h4. Running the Atlas Tools

The CertWare model transformations use the Eclipse Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) tools.  These features are selected in the target platform, and when the transformation plug-ins are deployed for user applications there is thus a dependency to the ATL features. 

The @*.argument.transform.*@ plug-ins are model transformation plug-ins.  These specify the ATL file and translation rules for converting one Ecore metamodel type into another.  In most cases we use this to transform a GSN model into an ARM model, for example.  The transformation of a model instance at run-time is thus done with the corresponding ATL launch configurations provided via the plugin.

h2. Packaging

The CertWare plug-ins and fragments 

h3. Delivery as a Feature

The several @net.certware.*@ plug-ins and fragments (not including the testing fragments) are combined into a feature and category definition in @net.certware.feature@.  Use the automated dependency calculation of the feature editor to identify the installation dependencies, then ensure there are no spurious plug-ins identified; if so, identify the source and repair the issue.  For complete feature deliveries, use the version tool in the feature editor to push the feature version identifier into the plugins and fragments.  Export to either a folder or archive file.  There are no platform-dependent requirements.  

To use the delivery, import the feature into an existing Eclipse workbench installation.  The feature will identify missing dependencies if any and prompt the user to install these prerequisites.  The feature and its contents are not digitally signed.  After installation, restart the workbench to update the commands and workbench parts.
