<h2>Patterns</h2>

The example wizard provides a list of patterns contributed to the workbench.  
Select one of the patterns for its resources to be copied into the workspace at the selected container.
The patterns then can be inserted into arguments by dragging onto the argument's editor,
or by opening both and cutting and pasting the parts wanted into the main argument.
