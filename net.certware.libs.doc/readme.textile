h1. CertWare Libs Doc Plug-in

This plugin is meant to contain the non-plugin Java libraries necessary to support @docx4j@.  The plugin contains the majority of dependencies for exporting graphics, HTML, PDF, and other capabilities of this package. The JAR files should include

bc. 
/net.certware.libs.doc/commons-vfs-patched-1.9.1.jar
/net.certware.libs.doc/docx4j-2.5.0.jar
/net.certware.libs.doc/fop-patched-0.95.756437.jar
/net.certware.libs.doc/hwpf-3.4.0.jar
/net.certware.libs.doc/jcr-1.0.jar
/net.certware.libs.doc/jdom-1.0.jar
/net.certware.libs.doc/log4j-1.2.15.jar
/net.certware.libs.doc/parent-pointer-plugin-1.0.jar
/net.certware.libs.doc/xalan-patched-2.7.0.jar

Later editions probably could be used so long as the interdependencies are resolved.
