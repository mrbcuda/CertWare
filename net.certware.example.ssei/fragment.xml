            author="Richard Hawkins"
            consequences="Once this pattern has been instantiated, a number of elements will remain undeveloped and requiring support. Firstly ‘Goal: sw contribution’ must be supported. The Software contribution safety argument pattern presented in this catalogue can be used to support this goal. In addition, an argument to support ‘Goal: contIdent’ must also be developed in module contIdent. This argument will be based on analysis performed at the system level, so in some cases a sufficient argument may exist at the system level which can be used to support this claim."
            idp="net.certware.example.ssei.pattern.hlssap"
            implementation="There are a number of different possible top goals for this pattern, as indicated by the public goals. The appropriate top level goal for the argument must be determined through consideration of the structure of any system safety argument which the software safety argu- ment supports. If the pattern is being used to support a system level safety argument, the top goal from this pattern may not actually appear at the top of the overall argument structure. Instead it will appear as a child-goal within the system safety argument. It is important that a stand alone software safety argument begins with the top goal ‘Goal: swSystem Safe’ to capture the overall objective of the argument and all the required contextual information."
            intent="This pattern provides the high-level structure for a software safety argument. The pattern can either be used to create the high level structure of a ‘stand alone’ software safety argument considering just the software aspects of the system, or alternatively can be used to support claims relating to software aspects within a broader system safety argument."

An instantiation of ‘Goal: SSRIdentify’ must be created for each identified software contribution to each system hazard. {tier n}, and {tier n+1} must be instantiated with the names of the relevant tier. Note that as the argument is developed over multiple tiers, {tier n} will refer to different tiers. {SSRn} is used to refer to a SSR at tier n, and should be instantiated with the SSR itself or a unique identifier for the SSR. Note that in this pattern the looping link represents a repeating pattern of argument, and would not appear in such a manner in an instantiated argument."

The software development process used will vary between different projects, however in all cases the software development is undertaken through varying levels of design. At each level the design must satisfy requirements of the higher level. These requirements may be explicitly captured as part of a requirements specification, or identified implicitly from the design itself. "
